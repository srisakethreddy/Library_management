Introduction: 
This Library Management System project is a Python-based solution that utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Its main goal is to simplify and streamline the process of managing books and library members. The code includes a class named “Library Management,” which holds several methods and variables that handle the different features of the system, including login, registration, adding books, removing books, issuing books, and returning books. Although this implementation is basic, it offers room for future enhancements and upgrades.
Explanation
‘import tkinter as tk’: This line imports the tkinter library and creates an alias tk to reference it easily.
‘from tkinter import messagebox’: This line imports the messagebox module from the
tkinter library, which provides dialog boxes to display messages.

3. The class ‘LibraryManagement’ is defined, which has a constructor method ‘

  init  ‘.

The ‘ init ‘ method creates a window with a title, dimensions, and a background color. It also initializes lists for books and a lend list.
Labels and entry boxes for username and password are created, along with Login and Register buttons.
The ‘login’ method checks the entered username and password against a list of librarians. If the credentials are correct, the login interface is destroyed and the ‘library_management_screen’ method is called.
The register method adds the entered username and password to the list of librarians.
The ‘library_management_screen’ method creates labels, entry boxes, and buttons for adding, removing, issuing, and viewing books.
The ‘add_book’ method adds the entered book to the list of books and displays a success message.
The ‘remove_book’ method removes the entered book from the list of books if it exists and displays a success message, or an error message if it doesn’t exist.
The ‘issue_book’ method moves the entered book from the list of books to the lend list if it exists and displays a success message, or an error message if it doesn’t exist.
The ‘view_books’ method displays a message box with a list of all the books in the library.
The if name == “ main “: block creates a ‘Tk’ object, initializes an instance of
‘LibraryManagement’, and starts the main event loop to display the window.

Some other information about Project
This is a library management system program. There is not very complex coding It is fully based on Python programming. We import some modules for GUI (Graphical User Interface).

There are some advantages of this program: –

It can store Unlimited number of books.
It stores data in memory of computer. (What can we add in it for improve)
We can borrow books from this program.
We can also remove books form it.
We have to create an account for accessing books.
There is also an option for Login
We can improve this by adding these functions: –

We can add a database in this program for storing Books.
We can add an option for uploading Documents, like pdf etc.
We can improve its Login and Create a new account feature.
So, we can improve this program by adding these features.
